*FINANCIAL REPORT*


BUDGET ANALYSIS:

Data was generated by accessing the PLAID api and getting transaction and income data for 
the last 90 days for one hypothetical client.

The data was placed into a pandas dataframe so that we could analyze it.

This pie chart show the categories of expenses.

We were to identify several categories of spending and the the total amounts. 

"Food and Drink"  1195.13
"Payment"         2103.50
"Recreation"        78.50
"Shops"            500.00
"Transfer"        6845.78
"Travel"            11.73

The top three were Transfers, Payments, and Food and Drink.

This bar chart shows the frequency of the transactions. By far, the highest was food and drink.

For the retirement analysis we were able to do 500 simulations over 30 years. The chart below
shows all of the simulations.

We created a histogram showing the potential returns. In addition, we calculated several confidence
intervals. The simulations let us see the client's risk of not being able to replace income
during retirement. 

![hist](images/hist.png)

Our conclusion was the client had a small chance of not being able to replace all of his income.
To avoid having a lower standard of living in retirement he could decrease his withdrawal rate,
increase his initial investment, save more, or retire later. Monte Carlo simulations can analyze the client's situation as these variables change.
